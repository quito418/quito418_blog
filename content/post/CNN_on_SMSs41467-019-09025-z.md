### Paper: [A multi-task convolutional deep neural network for variant calling in single molecule sequencing](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09025-z)
### Summary
Clairvoyante is a CNN based DNN which provides 4 kinds of predictions (1. Variant type 2. zygosity 3. alternative allele 4. indel length ).

Contributions.
1. Better accuracy and less computation in SMS.
2. Novel input encoding method

Notes.
- Due to class imbalance, it is hard to detect long indel. No support for indel bp>4

My questions
- What is cutoff, is it 33 the window size?
- Understand how input is constructed
- Is the labels the four output classes???
- Why is it better than DeepVariant?

## Algorithms explained 

### A-1. Constructing Input for the model
